    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    </div>
    <p>E-waste is a popular, informal name for electronic products nearing the end of their "useful life." Mobile Phones, Smart Phones, Feature phone, I Phones, Laptop, Desktop, Thin Clients, Air Conditioners, Televisions, Refrigerators, Washing Machines, VCDs, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are common electronic products. Many of these products can be reused, refurbished, or recycled.</p>
    <p>E-waste has been one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world. While e-waste contains valuable materials such as aluminium, copper, gold, palladium and silver, it also contains harmful substances like cadmium, lead and mercury. In the absence of proper awareness, disposing e-waste in landfill can result in toxic emissions to the air, water and soil and pose a serious health and environmental hazards.</p>

    <h2>Benefit of recycling of E-waste:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>E-waste contains many valuable, recoverable materials such as aluminum, copper, gold, silver, plastics, and ferrous metals. In order to conserve natural resources and the energy needed to produce new electronic equipment from virgin resources, electronic equipment can be refurbished, reused, and recycled instead of being land filled.</li>
    <li>E-waste also contains toxic and hazardous materials including mercury, lead, cadmium, beryllium, chromium, and chemical flame retardants, which have the potential to leach into our soil and water.</li>
    <li>Protects your surroundings- Safe recycling of outdated electronics promotes sound management of toxic chemicals such as lead and mercury.</li>
    <li>Conserves natural resources- Recycling recovers valuable materials from old electronics that can be used to make new products. As a result, we save energy, reduce pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and save resources by extracting fewer raw materials from the earth.</li>
    <li>Helps others - Donating your used electronics benefits your community by passing on ready-to-use or refurbished equipment to those who need it.</li>
    <li>Saves landfill space - E-waste is a growing waste stream. By recycling these items, landfill space is conserved.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>There are strategies we can also follow to help reduce the amount of e-waste. They include:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Be a good consumer. Do some research when you’re ready to buy a new product. Make sure it’s one that won’t break easily or become damaged shortly after you purchase it. In other words, look for products likely to have a much longer lifespan so you won’t need to replace it within a few years, or even months. It’s known that this is a common practice in the electronics industry; to make products with shorter life spans so more money can be earned in the long run when they break or malfunction.</li>
    <li>Reuse as often as possible. If you have parts and equipment that are still working, try repairing the electronic device before getting a new one. And if the device is beyond the point of being repaired, then recycle it.</li>
    <li>Educate yourself on what gets put into your electronics. Knowledge is power. Doing some research about the raw materials being used to manufacture your mobile phone or laptop helps you understand how harmful those materials and toxins can be if they’re tossed into a landfill. The more you educate yourself the more you can purchase items that won’t be harmful to the environment.</li>
    <li>Look for an environmentally friendly label. For example, see if the products you buy are labeled Energy Star, or have been certified by the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool.<br><br>Consider limiting the number of electronics you own. If you don’t really need an extra gadget, look for devices that have multiple functions.</li>
    <li>
    Teach kids about e-waste. Children are our future, and it helps if we can instill within them at a young age a commit to e-waste recycling.<br><br>
    Recycle, recycle, recycle. No matter what you have, it’s important to always dispose of your e-waste properly. That means recycling all of your used electronics, with the understanding that improperly disposing of e-waste is becoming more and more hazardous, particularly since the volume of e-waste has skyrocketed.<br><br>
    Understand security issues. All of your personal information remains stored on your electronic devices even if you delete it, so that’s another reason not to throw it away.<br><br>
    We can manage the e-waste and forage for elements that can be reused, recycled or responsibly disposed off.<br><br>
    We can also boost<br><br>
    e-waste recycling by implementing companywide recycling programs, and set up designated bins for consumers to bring their e-waste to be recycled.<br><br>
    These programs encourage customers to return old or broken products to their source, where they can then be recycled, refurbished or stripped of usable materials.
